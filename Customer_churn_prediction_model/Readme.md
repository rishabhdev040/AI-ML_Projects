# Customer Churn Prediction Model


In order to determine which customers are most likely to leave the bank, this project examines behavioral trends and customer account data.  The business can implement proactive retention strategies when at-risk customers are identified early.  Additionally, the model can be applied to any dataset that contains a churn indicator along with relevant customer characteristics that are proportionate to the churn variable.

## ✅ Key Functionalities

* Automatically handles missing values
* Converts categorical values into a format that is machine-friendly.
* Balances learning by scaling numerical features
* Divides data into sets for testing and training.
* Develops a model for churn prediction
* Uses F1-score, recall, accuracy, and precision to assess performance.
* Indicates which characteristics raise or lower the likelihood of churn.
